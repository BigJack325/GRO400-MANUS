# GRO400-MANUS
4th Semester Upgraded Hexapod Project for Robotique Engineering Sherbrooke University

<div id="ManUS" align="center">
    <h1>ManUS</h1>
    <h3>Hexapod Robot : Upgraded Version | Promo66-UdeS-GRO</h3>
</div>

**This academic project is based on an older academic project from robotic engineering undergraduates at Universit√© de Sherbrooke. "Manu" is an hexapod robot able to interact with his environments. Along with 6 legs comes a camera mounted on a 3D printed head, elevating Manu to a whole new level of robotic hexapod. It can walk, look around and chase targets all around him in a restrained area/arena.**

#### <a id="SetupUsers"></a>Setup for Users

- Clone or download the repository;
- Connect the hexapod's microcontroller (Arduino) to your computer;
- Open the file ```main.cpp``` in the *./Hexapod-Master/Hexapod_Arduino/src* folder, and build the code into the microcontroller with your favorite IDE;
- Disconnect the microcontroller from the computer and connect to the on-board computer (Raspberry Pi);
- Verify your Python version (3.5 and above) and verify if the OpenCV and PyQt5 librairies are present in the Raspberry Pi with ```Import``` command ;
- Run the file ```MANUS_QT``` in the *./Hexapod-Master/Hexapod_Qt* folder;
- Initialize the serial communication.

#### <a id= "assemblyguide">Assembly Guide</a>
You need to 3D print the necessary parts that you can find in the *./CAD* folder.   
We have a complete assembly guide [here](https://github.com/EDP325/GRO400-MANUS/wiki):

#### <a id="Codeexplication">Code Overview</a>

The code is divided in two main sections.  The first one is all about the robot movment and is directly written in the Arduino.  This code is written in switch case depending one the manuel/automatic mode and which movment to do.
The second section  includes the vision algorithm and the HMI.  It is written in the Raspberry Pi.  It is made to detect the chosen images and display some variable on the HMI, a screen connected to the Pi.  We chose to use VNCviewer to have a remote connection to the hexapod.

## <a id="Operation"></a>Robot Operation

#### <a id="Movement"></a>Robot Movement
The robot can move forward, backward and sideways.  It can also rotate clockwise and counterclockwise.  The head can rotate and the mandibles can open cand close.  

#### <a id="Vision"></a>Robot Vision
The robot has a vision algorithm that detects these two images:

#### <a id="Controls"></a>HMI And Robot Controls
Our HMI shows:
- the current view of the cam
- the position of all the servos;
- a map of the arena with the position of the hexapod;
- informations for the camera and messages from the Arduino
- a graphic that shows the the value of a variable over time
- buttons to move the robots
